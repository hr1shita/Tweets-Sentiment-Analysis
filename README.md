# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is based on the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/ashkhagan/smile-twitter-emotion-dataset?select=smile-annotations-final.csv which is composed of about 3k tweets.

The "Hidden_Emotions_Analysis.ipynb" notebook will contain the process of cleansing tweets (NLP), training a few Deep Learning models with different architectures using Keras API, and finally predicting and testing the model..
